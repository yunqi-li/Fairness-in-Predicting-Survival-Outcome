We use the implementation of SGDClassifer from scikit-learn package to run Logistic Regression, SVM, and Perceptron. Since the MLPClassifier of the scikit-learn package does not support the weighted loss function, we implement MLP with PyTorch. The learning rate is set to 0.005 and 𝑙2 regularization weight is 10−6. We choose 64 as the batch size for each active sampling step and run 5,000 active sampling iterations for the entire training stage. For MLP, we use a 2-layer neural network with hidden size (10, 5) with ReLU as the activation function. The learning rate is set to 0.001 with 𝑙2 regularization weight 10−4. For TCGA dataset, we set the trade-off parameter 𝑝 as 5%, while for SEER-18 dataset, we set the trade-off parameter 𝑝 as 20%, since the performance gap between patient groups of the SEER-18 dataset is very large, and it is more likely for the model to focus on only one group on this dataset. We use the average of five experiments as the final results to reduce randomness.
